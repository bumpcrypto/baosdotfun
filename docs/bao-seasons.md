# BAO Seasons: Curated Cultural Launches

**Why seasons?** 

 If you visit [daos.fun](http://daos.fun), the incentive of having so many different launches becomes eroded, as people seek to catch the next dao that is comming out the very next day, or even a few hours later. This leads to DAO tokens on daos.fun constantly dumping leading to the same mercenary games in the pursuit for big gains again. Seasons allow BAOs breathing room, from a value accrual perspective, introducing the IP to its holders, seeing its performance, etc. 

## Season Structure

Each BAO season represents a carefully curated launch period featuring a handful(current goal is six) exceptional BAOs chosen for their potential cultural impact, community strength, and strategic vision. These seasonal launches create focused periods of intense community engagement while maintaining high standards for BAO quality. Each season runs for three-six months, allowing sufficient time for communities to develop and strategies to mature.

## Selection Process

The selection of seasonal BAOs undergoes rigorous vetting to ensure each launch contributes meaningfully to the Berachain ecosystem. Selection criteria emphasizes:

Cultural Impact:

- Strong existing community presence
- Clear cultural identity and vision
- Unique contribution to the ecosystem and not seen before

Technical Readiness:

- Well-defined AI agent strategies
- [baos.fun](http://baos.fun) infrastructure can support the idea in meaningful time

Community Support:

- Active social media presence
- Engaged core team
- Community resources ready

## Season Mechanics

Launch Coordination:
Each season's BAOs launch in a coordinated sequence, with approximately two-four weeks between launches. This spacing ensures each BAO receives focused attention from the wider ecosystem while building anticipation for upcoming launches.

Social Amplification:
Every BAO launch is supported by a comprehensive social media campaign highlighting the unique aspects of each community. This includes:

- Community AMAs and Twitter Spaces
- Strategy reveals from AI agents
- Cultural content and community stories
- Behind-the-scenes looks at BAO development

## Seasonal Rewards

**End-of-Season Airdrops:**
Active participants across the season's BAOs receive rewards for their engagement. The airdrop structure rewards both depth of participation in individual BAOs and breadth of engagement across multiple BAOs within the season.

**Whitelist Access:**
Participants in each season earn priority access to the next season's BAO launches. This creates a virtuous cycle where engaged community members can continue to participate in high-quality launches.

**Community Recognition:**

- Enhanced governance rights
- Special access to future launches
- Community reputation points

## Quality Control

The seasonal structure enables strict quality control through:

- Limited launch slots creating natural scarcity
- Thorough vetting of potential BAOs
- Ongoing monitoring of launched BAOs to prevent scams

## Inter-Season Development

Between seasons, the focus shifts to:

- Analysis of successful strategies
- Community feedback collection
- Framework improvements
- Looking for new experimentations
- Next season preparation

Through this seasonal approach, baos.fun maintains high standards while creating sustained engagement periods that benefit both individual BAOs and the broader ecosystem. The limited number of launches per season ensures each BAO receives the attention and support needed for long-term success.
