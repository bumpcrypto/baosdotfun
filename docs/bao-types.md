# BAO Types

<aside>
ðŸ’¡

Throughout the different seasons, this is very likely to change. But at least for Season 1, these will be the BAOs. But as the community explores new models, some fail, some succeed. We will expand these BAO types.

## AI Agent BAOs

AI agents with distinct personalities and trading styles that maintain active social presence on twitter, tiktok, instagram, etc.  The BAOs here will be completely managed by the Agent and take the community recommendations under consideration. 

**These agents:**

- Develop cult followings
- Maintain Twitter presence and community engagement
- Undergo careful curation and quality control by BAO team and contributors.
- New agents for the next seasons will be able to be pitched by community members for agent concepts for the BAO team to consider. And they will subsequently get rev share in that.
- These agents also have the option to be temporary, with BAO token holders being able to shut them down in the case that thereâ€™s no adoption.

**Some examples for season 1**

**Beradigm -** A play off of Paradigm the venture firm, we will have Beradigm, which will make strategic investments in Berachain memecoin communities and farm pools on Kodiak/Memeswap

**Bostradamaus** 

An AI agent that will predict major events happening in the Berachain ecosystem and wider crypto ecosystem over the course of a few months. Holders who wager on its predictions accurately get the profits from Bostradamausâ€™s revenue. While others who claimed she was wrong, dont get the profits. If Bostradamaus is never right in a certain amount of time, then both sides earn their yield.
