# Whitelist System

# Overview

Instead of WL & insider games where anonymous people start hedge funds and steal the money but only get their friends rich, the BAO Protocol Season 1 implements a more sophisticated multi-tiered whitelisting system that prioritizes active participants in the Berachain ecosystem while maintaining fairness and accessibility for the broader community. 

This system is designed to ensure that early participation in BAO funds is allocated to users who demonstrate genuine engagement with and understanding of DeFi protocols or contributing to Berachain mindshare on twitter through Kaito yap boards.

## Tier 1: Protocol Engagement & Yap Priority

The highest tier of whitelist access is reserved for addresses that show substantial interaction with the specific Berachain protocols that the BAO's AI agents will be farming, as well as are strong contributors to Berachainâ€™s Yap Kaito board. 

These users receive priority allocation rights based on their historical engagement with these protocols/their mindshare on twitter. The system tracks several key metrics to determine eligibility:

- Active liquidity provision in relevant protocol pools
- Consistent trading activity across multiple Berachain DEXs
- Duration of protocol engagement
- Size and stability of positions maintained
- Complexity of DeFi operations executed
- amount of yapping done on Twitter

This tier receives the largest allocation caps and earliest access to new BAO launches, recognizing their demonstrated expertise and commitment to the ecosystem. However this is a lottery system where these addresses are rotated, to not create an over saturation of the same cabal over and over again per season.

## Tier 2: NFT Community and Token Holder Access

BAO launches as well incorporate dedicated allocation pools for specific Berachain NFT communities and token holders. This system recognizes the value of established community participation and long-term ecosystem alignment. The specific communities and tokens eligible for each BAO are selected based on their relevance to the BAO's trading strategies and community alignment.

### NFT Community Participation

- Holders of designated Berachain NFT collections can claim their whitelist spot through a dedicated interface on the BAO website
- Each eligible NFT collection receives its own allocation pool, preventing competition between different communities
- Multiple NFT holdings may increase allocation size up to predetermined caps
- Time-weighted holding periods may be considered to reward long-term community members

## Tier 3: General Lottery System

To maintain accessibility while managing demand, a portion of each BAO's allocation is distributed through a lottery system from our General Whitelist per season. Participants in this tier must meet basic qualification criteria:

- Hold a minimum amount of BERA
- Have completed at least one transaction on Berachain
- Register their interest during the designated windows

## Tier 4: Strategic Allocations

A limited number of whitelist spots are reserved for strategic allocations managed directly by the BAO operators. These allocations serve several purposes:

- Enabling participation from strategic partners and ecosystem contributors
- Providing access to experienced DeFi operators who can contribute to the agent strategies
- Creating opportunities for new users who show exceptional potential or commitment

This tier is capped at a fixed percentage of the total allocation to ensure it doesn't compromise the system's overall fairness.

## Allocation Caps and Distribution

Each tier operates with strict allocation caps to prevent concentration of ownership:

Example

- Tier 1: Up to A% of total BAO token supply per address
- Tier 2: Up to B% of total BAO token supply per address
- Tier 3: Up to C% of total BAO token
- Tier 4: Up to D% of total BAO token

These caps are dynamically adjusted based on total participation levels and market conditions, ensuring optimal distribution while maintaining sufficient liquidity for protocol operations.

## Claim Interface and Process

The BAO website features a streamlined claim interface during the BAO fundraising period where users can:

- Connect their wallet to verify holdings and eligibility
- View their qualification status across all tiers
- See real-time allocation sizes and caps
- Track claim windows and deadlines
- Complete any required verification steps
- Execute their claim when eligible

The interface provides clear feedback on qualification status and any missing requirements, helping users understand how to improve their position or access higher tiers.

## Verification and Anti-Gaming Measures

To maintain system integrity, all participating addresses undergo twitter verification to prevent gaming:

- Analysis of historical transaction patterns to identify potential Sybil attacks
- Monitoring of sudden spikes in protocol activity

## Progressing Between Tiers

The system incorporates mechanisms for users to progress to higher tiers through demonstrated engagement:

- Consistent protocol participation over time
- Maintenance of stable positions
- Engagement with protocol governance
- Contribution to protocol development and community

This creates a natural pathway for committed users to access greater allocation rights while maintaining the integrity of the tiering system in the inception of the BAO
