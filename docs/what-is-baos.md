# What is baos.fun?(Long)

# baos.fun: Reimagining Social Coordination(again) with crypto

This cycle, two narratives are converging: The return of ICO like fair launch mechanisms on tokens & AI agents. Fair launch is coming back because people are tired of billion dollar VC skems dumping on retail, and memecoins have become far too extractive for most retail users to see its use in it anymore. Meanwhile, AI agents date back to 2022, at the first launch of ChatGPT when frameworks like Langchain proliferated developer communities, but proved quite complicated and wasn’t a good experience. Hence Web2 ai agents not really taking off, nor web3. Now insert: the Eliza framework. The first time the ai developer community saw an agent framework that was modular enough for anyone to experiment with, and made it easy so that anyone could spin up agents. 

The desire for fair launch mechanims <> the world being ready to see AI agents finally come to life on chain lead to emergence of two protocols, amongst a sea of many others

Virtuals on Base: A completely fair launch protocol for ai agents. Essentially becoming a “pump fun” of ai agents. Allowing ai agent use cases of all different kinds to flourish on the platform, every agent having its own personality, and only being able to purchase the AI agent tokens through Virtuals. 

[daos.fun](http://daos.fun) on Solana: An approach where you can whitelist community members to join a DAO, where the community manager can trade memetokens spot. There are as well completely open DAO launches of daos.fun. The number one DAO on this dapp is ai16z, which was a groundbreaking new tech on the convergance of AI x crypto, where ai16z, an agent created by eliza, trades memecoins based on community recommendations 

daos.world: A base deployment of [daos.fun](http://daos.fun) with tighter controls over who gets to earn a dao, and is the first real EVM deployment of this model on Base. 

While we have been inspired by these builders, and have been big fans of their platforms, we have observed, at least what we think are cracks, in their armor that need to be fixed:

- **The whitelisting process:** This comes down to knowing the right people, or doing airdrop like quests to post on twitter & TG with a chance to win a WL spot. This creates many of the same issues that we already saw with memecoins, just reskinned in a different manner.
- **Too many DAOs/Agents Launching:** With so many DAOs launching on an almost daily basis, with a new whitelist being available the next day, or another agent coming out, its more advantageous to just dump your bags and try to catch the next one than to hold. As well, with so many DAOs launching this leads to more scammers/grifters coming in. Or the core team has to up their vetting process, which gets very tedious in and of itself. This [pump.fun](http://pump.fun) style model may have worked for memecoins, but when we’re putting this on an ICO and with AI Agents it turns things that are genuinely interesting and new to crypto, into just another extractive game.
- **Lack of IP & Narrative:** Its by no mistake that the most successful DAO, ai16z, has been so successful. It has a monumental story. And inspired builders all around the world. Since then a flurry of agents & respective DAOs have come up, all attempting to find some witty version of AI x some venture firm, crypto person, etc. Started by anons with no merit to what they’re claiming to do in any capacity. No trust is built up between the community and the underlying DAO managers or agent developers. The ones who express their visions the best, ie Vader on Base, or DRUGS on [daos.fun](http://daos.fun) have taken well due to them telling a story and accumulating IP amongst their communities. This attracted more and more traders to them. And is by no mistake as to why they shined vs. the flurry of other agents/DAOs.
- **Lack of incentive alignment:** We alluded to this earlier, but the incentives between agents and their communities are just not aligned. A token is not good enough, spamming CAs into the agent’s chat is not good enough, and expecting holders to hold an asset that can swing 300% up and 80% down the next day isn’t good enough either. Builders/DAO managers want to build community, raise funds, experiment with new models. Holders want to speculate on the DAO and its team(whether it be an agent or human traders). And the underlying platform wants both their DAOs & users to be long term users and win from their platform. But when we start to play the same extractive games for hype, grinding for privileged access, knowing the right people, launch DAO after DAO. Agent after Agent. Then we start to repeat many of the same issues that we already saw with ICOs & we’re repeating the same mistakes of Web2 SaaS startups that wrapped around foundational models like GPT-4 and Claude, only to be made obsolete with the next API update.

The emergence of AI agents and fair launch mechanisms has revealed both the potential and pitfalls of combining AI agents with communities and the DAO fundraising model.  While platforms like Virtuals and daos.fun pioneered important concepts, **baos.fun** represents the next evolution, built on Berachain's unique advantages and learning from previous limitations.

baos.fun is a protocol that is more than just about AI agents farming or trading. As well its more than just about BAOs raising whitelist for the early adopters to get rich. It's a new way to get people excited about interacting on chain without having to worry about the cabals, the insider games, or the complex mechanics of DeFi. Through the combination of AI agents serving as  tools for transaction executions, proven communities launching their own BAOs, and Berachain's Proof of Liquidity system creating genuine incentive alignment, we're building something that adds a social fabric on top of DeFi. 

Just as we saw how Berachain's Bong Bears NFT collection sparked a movement that led to an entire chain launching, we believe BAOs represent the next evolution of crypto social coordination. In the same way that NFT communities and DAOs captured the imagination last cycle before ultimately being undermined by insider games, operational overhead, and governance theater, BAOs - powered by AI agents automating their operations for profit - create a new paradigm for sustainable communities. Imagine if a BAO was able to not only trade on chain, but strategically invest in new communities, assets, merchandise, or even spend it on a party at Token2049 based off their profits? Its a new way to coordinate communities and bring value onchain.

 [baos.fun](http://baos.fun) isn’t just a play to ride the narratives of today. We forsee several multi billion dollars BAOs with cultural assets, vibrant communities, strong teams, etc. that move past crypto twitter and into the minds of passive crypto investors who want more exposure to on chain value creation and entertainment. 

### **How will this happen?**

### Quality Over Quantity

Instead of fostering an environment where endless launches drive mercenary behavior, baos.fun implements a seasonal model with carefully curated launches of different BAOs. Each BAO represents a meaningful addition to the ecosystem, backed by established communities and clear value propositions. This isn't a platform for anonymous teams to launch a quick-flip riding off the current narrative; it meets existing and new Berachain communities where they’re at by helping to enhance their coordination and value creation. This as well significantly reduces the mercenary mentality around platforms with this pre sale model, as since there’s scarcity, its better to see an investment through, and enjoy the perks of being in the BAO, than to try to ape into the next whitelist. 

### Beyond Traditional Whitelisting

Previous platforms struggled with arbitrary whitelisting processes that recreated the same insider games they sought to eliminate. baos.fun takes a different approach by leveraging Berachain's existing ecosystem engagement. Access is earned not from your connections and spamming on Twitter/TG, but through meaningful contribution in the Berachain ecosystem from your activity on chain or contributing to mindshare on Twitter - providing liquidity, using protocols, contributing to communities. 

### Built on Authentic IP

Berachain's rich ecosystem of brands, lore, and narratives provides the perfect foundation for meaningful BAO development. Communities like Bera Baddies, Steady Teddys, Hungry Beras, established protocols like Kodiak and Yeet, and even some validators already have authentic identities and engaged communities. BAOs become natural extensions of these existing cultural assets rather than artificial constructs seeking narrative fit. And as well, our AI agents can become just as entertaining as they are utilitarian on chain through content curation that builds on this IP. 

### Aligning BAO Tokens Through Proof of Liquidity

The key innovation comes through Berachain's Proof of Liquidity mechanism. Instead of relying solely on token mechanics, BAOs align incentives through the PoL system. Communities earn BGT rewards through meaningful protocol engagement, agents optimize for sustainable value creation and enjoy short-term pumps through memecoin trading, and the platform grows through genuine ecosystem development rather than hype cycles.

### Berachain’s Robust Ecosystem of Applications

Many chains are attempting to pursue the current AI Agent narrative. But none of them have the  robust DeFi and application system ecosystem provides baos agents with legitimate yield sources, trading venues, and surfaces to execute on, coupled with the greater meta game of the sustainable value creation mechanisms in Proof of Liquidity. AI agents serve as execution tools for BAOs around real DeFi opportunities rather than just being speculative trading vehicles. This creates natural alignment between communities, agents, and the BAO protocol.

### The Seasonal Approach to baos.fun

In crypto, we've seen how rapid, unconstrained launches can quickly exhaust community interest and create perverse incentives. When there's always another token launching tomorrow, today's community becomes tomorrow's exit liquidity. baos.fun takes a different approach through carefully curated seasonal launches. Each season features just a few BAOs(3-6), chosen for their cultural significance, community strength, and innovative approaches. These seasonal drops serve as our laboratory for experimenting with different distribution mechanisms, agent capabilities, and community engagement models - while the limited number ensures each launch gets the attention and resources it needs to develop into something meaningful. Rather than exhausting communities with endless launches, we're creating a framework where genuine innovation can thrive and each BAO has the opportunity to make a lasting impact on the ecosystem.

### Do you understand now?

baos.fun isn't just another platform for launching tokens and riding a hot narrative; it's an entirely new framework for enhancing social coordination with crypto's new tools & mechanism designs. Just as NFTs & ICOs did in their respective times, we believe that BAOs are the next iterations of that and brings back the spirit of what crypto was originally all about. At its core, crypto enables open, permissionless markets where anyone can participate without gatekeepers or privileged access. BAOs extend this foundation by creating sustainable communities around automated money-making tools, allowing anyone to participate in sophisticated DeFi strategies without needing insider connections or complex technical knowledge alongside their pfp communities, memecoin communities, or even being lead by cult of personality AI agents.
